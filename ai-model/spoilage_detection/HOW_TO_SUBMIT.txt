                    HOW TO SUBMIT - STEP BY STEP GUIDE
================================================================================

STEP 1: START THE SERVICE
-------------------------
Windows: Double-click "START_HERE.bat"
Mac/Linux: Run "./START_HERE.sh"

Wait until you see: "✅ Service is ready!"


STEP 2: TEST THE FEATURE
-------------------------
1. Open your frontend application
2. Go to "Inventory Management" page
3. Click "Detect Spoilage" button
4. Use camera to capture a fruit or vegetable
5. Show the results:
   - Item detected (e.g., "Apple")
   - Spoilage level (e.g., "Fresh")
   - Days remaining (e.g., "5 days")


STEP 3: EXPLAIN THE TECHNOLOGY
-------------------------------
Say:
- "Uses YOLO for detecting which fruit/vegetable it is"
- "Uses CNN model trained on Kaggle datasets for spoilage detection"
- "Works automatically without any manual setup"


WHAT'S INCLUDED:
----------------
✅ YOLO Detection - Detects which fruit/vegetable
✅ Spoilage Detection - Detects if fresh or spoiled
✅ Days Remaining - Estimates how many days item can be used
✅ Automatic Setup - Everything works with one click


FILES TO SHOW:
--------------
- START_HERE.bat / START_HERE.sh (one-click startup)
- app/main.py (main service code)
- app/yolo_detector.py (YOLO integration)
- SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md (full documentation)


IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG:
------------------------
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Run: cd ai-model/spoilage_detection/app
3. Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run: python main.py


THAT'S IT! YOU'RE READY TO SUBMIT!
